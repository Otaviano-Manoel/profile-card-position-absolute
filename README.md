### What I learned

I practiced responsiveness in this project, found it quite straightforward, and believe I used responsive design effectively.

### Continued development

For my next project, I will study JavaScript to begin practicing the interaction between the UI and the client.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - 
I used W3Schools to clarify my doubts and I really liked their examples, which clarify how to use CSS properties.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) - I'd like you to get to know MDN Web Docs, which helped me a lot in understanding HTML tags.
